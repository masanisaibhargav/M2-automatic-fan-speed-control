## **COMPONENT DESCRIPTION**

-  ###### Microcontroller
An integrated circuit that contains a microprocessor along with memory and associated circuits and those controls some or all the functions of an electronic device (such as a home appliance) or system.

-  ###### Temperature Sensor
A temperature sensor is a device that is designed to measure the degree of hotness or coolness in an object. The working of a temperature meter depends upon the voltage across the diode.

- ###### Digital Temperature Sensor
The TC74 is a serially accessible, digital temperature sensor particularly suited for low cost and small formfactor applications. Temperature data is converted from the onboard thermal sensing element and made available as an 8-bit digital word.

- ###### DC Motor
A DC motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. In a DC motor, the input electrical energy is the direct current which is transformed into the mechanical rotation.

- ###### Motor Driver
The motor driver IC is an integrated circuit chip used as a motor controlling device in autonomous robots and embedded circuits. A motor driver is undoubtedly something that makes the motor move as per the given instructions or the inputs (high and low).

- ###### LCD
LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.
